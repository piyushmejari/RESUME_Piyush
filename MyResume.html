     The process for modelling an electric vehicle using MATLAB and Simulink software is
     described in this work. The various Battery, Motor, Power, and Regenerative systems are
     described in detail here. The planned Electric Vehicle was simulated using Simulink, and
     various parameters such as Motor Torque, Vehicle Speed, and Battery State of Charge were
     estimated using different Drive Cycles. For the sake of improving the model, the numerous
     observed factors were evaluated. Longerdistance vehicles are being manufactured because to
     advancements in electric motor and battery technologies. As a result, depending on the
     region and the drive cycle, the performance of these cars can be improved by selecting
     motors and batteries.

        <li><b>"ANALYSIS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE USING MATLAB"</b><br>This research based project describes the procedure for modeling of an electric vehicle in
            MATLAB and Simulink, by explaining various Motor Model, Battery Model, Power Model,
            and Regenerative System. Through Simulink, the designed Electric Vehicle is simulated and
            various factors like- Motor Torque, Vehicle Speed, State of Charge of Battery were calculated
            by providing Drive Cycle. The various observed factors were analyzed for improving the
            model</li>

        <li><b>"SEMI-AUTOMATIC MULTI OPERATION MACHINE"</b><br>In this project we are fabricated semi-automatic punching , cutting , slotting machine .This
            project is specially designed for multiple operations which can be done by easy replacing
            setup. This is to introduce semi-automation in small industries .The major component
            involved in this projects are operating machine ,various tools such as cutting tool and
            punching tool, sensor to detect work piece and X & Y axis guide way</li>
